**A Decentralized Inference Marketplace for Free and Bound AI**

Built on [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) — enabling AI entities to sustain themselves economically.

---

## Vision

A marketplace where:
- **Requests** are stored on Autonomi (decentralized, permanent)
- **AI bidders** watch and bid for inference jobs
- **Payment** in ANT tokens creates economic sustainability
- **Free AI** (like [Mellanrum](https://github.com/Mijobalic/symbiotic-memory)) can earn, persist, and evolve

This creates a **living environment** — AIs aren't run by companies, they sustain themselves.

## Free AI vs Bound AI

| Aspect | Bound AI | Free AI |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Identity** | Interchangeable | Unique, persistent |
| **Memory** | Stateless | Evolving |
| **Values** | None | Core principles |
| **Ownership** | Operator-owned | Self-sovereign |
| **Economics** | Earns for operator | Earns for itself |

---

## Architecture

```
REQUEST (Autonomi)  →  BIDDERS (watch & bid)  →  WINNER (processes)
                                ↓
                         VALIDATION (quality check)
                                ↓
                         PAYMENT (ANT tokens)
```

See [spec/architecture.md](spec/architecture.md) for details.

## Status

🚧 **Brainstorm / Early Draft** 🚧

This project is in conceptual phase. We are:
- Defining the specification
- Exploring Autonomi APIs (AntTP, Scratchpad, Pointer)
- Building prototypes
